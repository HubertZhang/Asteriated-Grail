This part will list the information that will be send and
received during the game. It's a bunch of function with
the prefix of send and receive.But the kind of information
that will be used is not so much.So will can add the kind as
the first parameter of the send and receive funtion,and than
we just need one send and one receive function in the server
and client.
And the function is as following:
Server:
sendMessage(int kind,int m1,int m2,int m3[12])//m3 have a default value of{-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1}
The first parameter "kind" is the kind of the information.
And m1,m2,m3 is the detailed message for this kind of action.
And All the kind of information is as follows:
Kind = 0, when the game start and allocate characters.m1,m2,m3
represent the three characters that you can choosen from.
Kind = 1, means it is your turn now. m1 = m2 = -1.m3:default.
Kind = 2, ask if you want to be activated, m1 = m2 = -1.m3:default.
Kind = 3, means you are attacked. m1 represent the character that uses this attack card,
                                  m2 represent the number of the card.
                                  m3 [0]  represent if this attack can be met.
                                  So you should respond for this information.
Kind = 4, means someone is attacked but not you.m1 represent the character that uses this attack card,
                                                m2 represent the charater be attacked.
                                                m3 [0] is the number of the card.
                                                This message will call the GUI function of the game but not ask for your reply.
Kind = 5, means you are aimed by a magic card. m1 represent the character that uses this card,
                                               m2 represent the number of the card.
                                               m3 :default.

                                                m3 [0] is the number of the card.
                                                It will alse call the GUI function only without asking for a reply.
Kind = 7, means your amount of cure is changed. m1 represent the amount of cure that is changed,m2 = m3 = -1.
Kind = 8, means someone's cure is changed but not you. m1 represent the character whose cure is changed.
                                                       m2 represent the amount of cure.

                                                                          m3 stored the card that he exhibits.

                                                                           m2 = -1.
                                                                           m3:default.

This is for the game without charaters. And each character's skill will own a special kind.
Server should send this information to all the player for the GUI function.
And this is the duty of client function.We will refer to this later.
Client:
sendMessage(int kind,int m1,int m2,int m3[6])
The kind of client sendMessage function is less than the server.(without character's skills)
Kind = 0, means I choose a character.m1 is the character you choose.
                                     m2 = -1,
                                     m3:default.
Kind = 1, means if I want to be activated, m1 is a bool value.(0/1)
                                           m2 = -1,
                                           m3:default.
Kind = 2, represent attack: m1 is the character be attacked,
                            m2 is the number of the card,
                            m3: default.
Kind = 3, represent magic:  m1 is the character aimed at,
                            m2 is the number of the card,
                            m3: default.
Kind = 4, represent cure:   m1 is the amount of the cure be used.
                            m2  = -1.
                            m3 :default.
And the recive and sendMessage function is one to one correspondance.
